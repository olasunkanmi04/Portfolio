Afiaanyi is an e-commerce marketplace targeted at the Easterners of Nigeria. Where businesses can upload their various products and users can come to make a purchase of goods of their choice.

I worked alongside another front-end developer. I converted the UI designs to a mobile responsive web application. 

## Seller's Dashboard

I worked on an extensive seller's dashboard, where businesses upload and manage products, manage orders and transactions.

I used chartjs to create a statistical graph for sellers to monitor order volume, sales rate and generate sales report. And a table to track order progress, from the creation of order to shipment and completion of the order.
