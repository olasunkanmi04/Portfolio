Atom Insure offers an affordable and accessible insurance service for everyone in Africa, starting with Nigeria, by building a smart, simple and easy to understand insurance product.

I developed different parts of the Atom Insure platform, converting complex UI to web and mobile-ready application using Reactjs and integrating APIs from the backend team using Axios.

## Progressive Web Application(PWA)

Atom target of making insurance service available to everyone in Africa led to the decision to have a mobile-first application as most of its user will access the platform with their phones. So I code the UI of a PWA that comprises an extensive and very intuitive onboarding flow and a user dashboard to purchase, file claims, add beneficiaries and monitor Policies.

## For Business

I also worked on the business-facing part of Atom for businesses to provide amazing insurance benefits for their Clients. 

I built a web application that features onboarding and verification of a business, a wallet system and a dashboard to keep track of their number of clients and policies purchased or claimed.
